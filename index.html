      'answer': "Answer: We believe in God the Father Almightly, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.",
      'verse': "Jude 1:3 - I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints."

      'verse': "Galatians 2:16 - Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified."
    },
    {
      'question': "Question 14. Since we are redeemed by grace alone, through Christ alone, must we still do good works and obey God's Word?",
